# Object Detection Vehicle Counts using YOLO V8

Object Detection Vehicle Counts is a computer vision project that uses deep learning techniques to detect and count the number of Vehicle in the videos. This project can help me enhance my knowledge in computer vision, and I have found this awesome project and materials from CVZone.

## Features

- Detect and count Vehicle in Cars.mp4 video.
- High-accuracy object detection is achieved using state-of-the-art deep learning models. We have tried YOLOv8n and YOLOv8l weights.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/): PyCharm relies on a Python interpreter to run your code. Make sure Python is installed on your system.

- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/): Download and install PyCharm Community.
  
## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:** If you're working with an existing Python project hosted on GitHub or another version control platform, clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Car count yolov8n.py file
