learning Machine learning algorithms.

### [Project_5 - Home Price Prediction](https://github.com/Akhilpm156/Python_Projects/tree/43495648d78b798f972fccbfe4a538cca8afb59e/home%20price%20Predict)

In this is project build a regression Mechine learning model to predict price of house. learning and data resources from codebasics
this project is end to end project that include building website,model, and python flask server.

### [Project_6 - Deep_learning_project_cnn](https://github.com/Akhilpm156/Python_Projects/tree/572fe74bb0dd02e34255da88229b54e2248bb6fa/Deep_learning_project_cnn)

I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying tomato diseases as part of an exercise based on the Codebasics (YouTube) Deep Learning With TensorFlow 2.0, Keras, and Python tutorial. In this project, I utilized TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries. To reduce computation, I selected a subset of images for each class and performed data augmentation. then loaded the augmented data into TensorFlow Datasets, built the model, and saved it for future use   ----> [Jupyter Notebook File](https://github.com/Akhilpm156/Python_Projects/blob/572fe74bb0dd02e34255da88229b54e2248bb6fa/Deep_learning_project_cnn/Tomato%20disease.ipynb)

### [Project_7 - Churn prediction Ann](https://github.com/Akhilpm156/Python_Projects/tree/2aa1ef348848953fc0cb6d32164415d010eee2a7/Churn%20prediction%20Ann)

I created a Customer Churn Prediction model using TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn as part of my learning journey. This project demonstrates my proficiency in deep learning and machine learning techniques, showcasing my ability to work with real-world datasets, preprocess data, and fine-tune models. The model offers actionable insights for businesses to retain customers, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.----> [Jupyter Notebook File](https://github.com/Akhilpm156/Python_Projects/blob/2aa1ef348848953fc0cb6d32164415d010eee2a7/Churn%20prediction%20Ann/Customer%20Churn%20Prediction%20Using%20ANN.ipynb)
